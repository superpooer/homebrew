*Change Directory eXtended* (or enhanced or whatever)
Makes the prompt more unix like (at least how I have my PS1).
Currently is `dir> ` where dir is the lowest level directory you're in.
May add a bootstrapper in future to allow for more options while keeping the executed code as small as possible.
